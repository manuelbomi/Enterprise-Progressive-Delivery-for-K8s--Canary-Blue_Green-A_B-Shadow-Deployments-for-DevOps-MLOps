# Enterprise Progressive Delivery for Kubernetes — Canary, Blue/Green, A/B, Shadow Deployments for DevOps & MLOps



> A complete, production-oriented guide describing **progressive delivery** of applications and ML models on Kubernetes.  
> Covers Canary rollouts, Blue/Green swaps, A/B testing, shadow testing, monitoring-driven promotion/rollback, and automated CI/CD + GitOps workflows. Includes **detailed, well-commented code examples** (Kubernetes, Istio, Argo Rollouts, Prometheus rules, GitHub Actions, and example model validation scripts).

## Introduction & Goals

Progressive delivery lets teams deploy new application versions or ML models **gradually** to production, observe their behavior, and either promote or roll back based on run-time signals (latency, errors, and model-specific metrics like accuracy or data drift). This approach reduces risk and enables faster iteration.

This README explains *how* progressive delivery is implemented in Kubernetes-based enterprise environments and provides concrete examples you can copy into your repos.

## Key Concepts and Patterns

- **Canary Deployment** — deploy new version to a small percentage of traffic, observe metrics, incrementally increase traffic until 100% or rollback.  
- **Blue/Green Deployment** — run two full environments (Blue = current, Green = new). Switch traffic from Blue → Green atomically (DNS or load balancer).  
- **A/B Testing** — route distinct cohorts of real users to different versions to measure business KPIs (CTR, conversion).  
- **Shadow Testing** — mirror real production traffic to the new version without serving the new version's responses to users; used to validate behavior under real load.  
- **Automated Rollback** — configured alerts or analysis results trigger automatic rollback to the previous safe release.  
- **Analysis-driven Promotion** — use observability (Prometheus metrics, model quality logs) to decide whether to proceed with rollout steps.

## Architecture & Components

Typical components in a progressive delivery pipeline:

- **Kubernetes cluster(s)** — runtime for pods
- **Ingress / Service Mesh** — Istio, Linkerd, or Kuma for traffic shaping/splitting
- **Deployment controller** — Argo Rollouts (for Canary/Blue-Green orchestration) or native k8s + custom controllers
- **Observability** — Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards), Loki (logs)
- **Model monitoring** — custom metrics endpoints, Prometheus exporters, or model-monitoring platforms (e.g., WhyLabs, Evidently)
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI for building images and updating manifests
- **GitOps** — ArgoCD or Flux for auto-syncing Git → cluster
- **Alerting** — Alertmanager for Prometheus to notify and optionally trigger webhook-based rollbacks
